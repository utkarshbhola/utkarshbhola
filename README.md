# Greetings! I'm utkarshbhola 👋

### Building backend systems from first principles — Go, distributed systems, and infra-oriented projects.

### 🌐 About Me
I focus on backend and systems engineering, with an emphasis on understanding how things work internally, not just how to use frameworks.

To do this, I build small but realistic system implementations such as:

in-memory data stores

message queues

geo-based backend services

These projects help me reason about networking, concurrency, data flow, scalability, and design tradeoffs that show up in real production systems.

Currently exploring Go, distributed systems fundamentals, and backend architecture.
